Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and classify patients with diabetes based on their medical history and clinical data.
The model should take into account factors such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and family history of diabetes.

The model should be trained on a large dataset of patients with and without diabetes, and validated on a separate dataset to ensure its accuracy and generalizability.
The goal is to create a model that can assist healthcare providers in making early and accurate diagnoses of diabetes, leading to better patient outcomes and improved healthcare efficiency.
